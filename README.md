# 🧠 Prisoner's Dilemma Simulator

An interactive web-based simulator of the classic **Prisoner's Dilemma** game, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project allows users to simulate multiple rounds between different strategic players and analyse their behaviour, scoring, and long-term performance.

## 📌 About the Project

The **Prisoner's Dilemma** is a fundamental problem in game theory that explores cooperation and competition between two rational players.

This simulator enables:

- Custom number of rounds (5–50)
- Adjustable mistake ratio (0–50%)
- Multiple built-in strategies
- Real-time round visualisation
- Cumulative statistics tracking
- Light/Dark mode toggle
